I am Kwing Hei "Heili"[^1] Li, a PhD student at Aarhus University under the supervision of Lars Birkedal.

Before that, I was a MPhil in Advanced Computer Science student at King's College, University of Cambridge. Before that, I was a Computer Science with Mathematics undergraduate at Churchill College, University of Cambridge (I was  one of the last since this combination was not an option anymore after my cohort!). In the past, I did research internships at the CaMLSys Lab and MPI-SWS.

I am interested in the design, implementation, and verification of tools for software engineering and programming languages, through techniques from type theory, program logic, and category theory. I also spend a fair amount of time thinking about formal verification, protocols for distributed systems, and donkeys.

My favourite mammal is the [donkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey). 

<!--- 
Whenever I am free, I spend my  time [coxing]({%link other/coxing.markdown %}) on the river or writing humorous [poems]({% link  other/poems.markdown %}). I am also extremely passionate about giving speeches and presentations, and I won some [awards]({% link  projects/entropy.markdown %}) for my talks in the past.
