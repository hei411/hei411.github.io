## Details
This [report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05342) presents a formalization of May's theorem in the proof assistant Coq. It describes how the theorem statement is first translated into Coq definitions, and how it is subsequently proved. Various aspects of the proof and related work are discussed. To the best of my knowledge, this project is the first documented attempt in mechanizing May's Theorem.
