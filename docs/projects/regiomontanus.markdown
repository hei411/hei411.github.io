## Details

This is an article I submitted to Mathematiko, the annual Mathematics magazine at my high school. I described a [classical construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction) method to solve the [Regiomontanus' Angle Maximization Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiomontanus%27_angle_maximization_problem), and provided a proof of the algorithm.

The article could be found [here]({% link  other/mathematiko.pdf %}).
