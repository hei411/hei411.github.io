Status: Completed  
Year: 2020  
## Details
This public presentation was part of the [Churchill CompSci Talks](https://talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/15345) 2020-21 Series. I first first covered the definition of Claude Shannon's entropy and its role in the [Source Coding Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%27s_source_coding_theorem). After discussing the importance of this theorem in Information Theory, I presented a proof sketch of the theorem using simple results in Probability Theory and Analysis. The slides for the talk can be found [here]({% link  projects/docs/entropy_slides.pdf %}).

## Results
My talk received the highest number of votes ever achieved in the history of the CompSci Talks (achieved more than twice the number of votes than any other speaker that year), and I was awarded the Audience Favourite Talk Prize for it.
