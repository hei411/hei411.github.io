## Details

This is an article I submitted to Mathematiko, the annual Mathematics magazine at my high school. I described a classical construction method to solve the Regiomontanus' Angle Maximization, and provided a proof of the algorithm.

The article could be found [here]({% link  projects/docs/mathematiko.pdf %}).
