I am Kwing Hei "Heili" Li, a PhD Student in the [Logics and Semantics group](https://logsem.github.io/) at [Aarhus University](https://cs.au.dk/). My supervisor is [Lars Birkedal](https://cs.au.dk/~birke/)[^1].  


I develop higher-order separation logics to reason about higher-order probabilistic programs, especially those that might involve concurrency. I am also interested in other relatively theoretical aspects of programming languages, especially type theory. Most of my research is formalized in the [Rocq](https://rocq-prover.org/) proof assistant under the [Iris](https://iris-project.org/index.html) logic framework. The only situations when I have to resort to pen-and-paper proofs are the times when I accidentally left my laptop at home; I am intelligent enough to not trust my calculations and God forbid I attempt to read my own handwriting.   

Before that, I was an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science student at King's College, [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/). And before that, I was a Computer Science with Mathematics undergraduate at Churchill College, University of Cambridge.  

My outie's favourite mammal is the [donkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey).
