Status: Completed  
Year: 2021  
## Details
This group design project is a coursework for the Part IB Computer Science Tripos. I, together with five other students designed and implemented an Android mobile application that simulates the process of landing a plane with the Instrument Landing System for our client Softwire. Users are able to create, save and load cutomised simulations that will display clear and accurate changes on the simulated cockpit instrument based on relative GPS position of the mobile device. A video about the overall project can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsgbl59c4DI&ab_channel=CambridgeComputerLab). A comparison video between the simulated ILS instrument in our app and a 'real' instrument in flight simulator can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KDYblHuQfg). 

## Results
This project was a huge success and all major components and extensions have been implemented and tested comprehensively. Phil Marsden, our client tested our app on a real flight and reported that "it was flawless".

This was honestly one of my best experiences working in a group project for there were few conflicts throughout the term and everyone was very serious and passionate about getting the software to work properly. Huge thanks to my teammates and our client for making this project such an enjoyable experience, and most importantly, a great success.
