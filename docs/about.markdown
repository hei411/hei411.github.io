I am Li Kwing Hei (or simply known as Hei Li), a Computer Science with Mathematics student at Churchill College, University of Cambridge.  

I am interested in the design, implementation and verification of tools for software engineering and programming languages, through techniques from Type Theory, Mathematical Logic and Category Theory.

Whenever I am free, I spend my  time coxing on the river or writing humorous [poems]({% link  other/poems.markdown %}). I am also extremely passionate about giving speeches and presentations, and I won some [awards]({% link  projects/entropy.markdown %})) for my talks in the past.

This is the most handsome photo of myself I could find on my phone:
