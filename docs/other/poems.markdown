## M2's June Eights Regatta Race Report on Day 1

On our first regatta race, our crew  
Was up against LMBC M2.  
With our heads focused and ready,  
“Come forward, squared, buried”  
And when the sound “go” was uttered, off we flew. 



Despite our best efforts, slowly did they pull away,  
And held us behind to the finish from railway.   
However, our unofficial split of 1:48  
Was an improvement from yesterday’s rate,  
And with our heads held up high, M2 Torpedo looks forward to our race the next day.

## On One Side
If they made paper  
In the form of Möbius strip -   
Think how much easier  
To read what's underneath  
Without a flip.

## Recursion
If you're searching for ways  
To spice up your poem,  
Just add a Latin phrase:  
*Quod erat demonstrandum*.

## Miss Dandelion
Miss Dandelion settled near a lake -  
A heaven she found delightsome.  
Though while her roots of stability grew,  
She lost her wings of freedom.

When her children sprouted wings of their own,  
She gladly set them free.  
Each embarked on their own adventure  
Of certain uncertainty.
