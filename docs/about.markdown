I am Kwing Hei "Heili"[^1] Li, a PhD student at Aarhus University under the supervision of Lars Birkedal.

Before that, I was a MPhil in Advanced Computer Science student at King's College, University of Cambridge. Before that, I was a Computer Science with Mathematics undergraduate at Churchill College, University of Cambridge[^2]. 

I am interested in the design, implementation, and verification of tools for software engineering and programming languages, through techniques from type theory, program logic, and category theory. I also spend a fair amount of time thinking about formal verification, protocols for distributed systems, and donkeys.

My favourite mammal is the [donkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey).
