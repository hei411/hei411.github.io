<h3 style="text-align: center;">Prelude</h3>
The year was 2020. 

For my first writing assigment that academic year, the task was to *write a short story about "flight" with a twist ending*. After much thinking (of roughly 10 seconds), I drafted out an awesome writing plan, and proceeded to write a kick-ass story describing a plane flight, where a hijack occurred at the very end. Pleased with myself, I believed it was a really creative piece of work. Surely, no one could have seen THAT coming.

That night, the teacher read and marked 30 short stories, all of which involved a plane that got hijacked at the very end. 

Today, I decided to revisit this writing prompt and give it another shot. This time, I really pushed myself to really create something a bit more unique than the plot of a hijacked plane.

After all, there are more horrifying things that could occur on a plane...
