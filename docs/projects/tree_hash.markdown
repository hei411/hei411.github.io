title: 'Tree Isomorphism Problem - A Hashing Approach'

Status: Completed  
Year: 2018  
(This was a project I did in high school, before I had any formal training in Algorithms. Therefore, this project may not be as impressive as the others...)


## Details

This is a report submitted by Wesley Jon (now a student reading Mathematics at Emma College, Cambridge) and myself on the efficiency of determining instances of tree isomorphisms from a large number of rooted, labelled trees by a hashing algorithm. We proposed a simple hashing algorithm, and analzyed its time complexity and soundness. We also implemented it in C++,  compared its efficiency with the AHU algorithm against test cases of varying number of trees and tree sizes, and showed that the experimental data agreed with our theoretical results. We lastly suggested a number of  optimization techniques for our algorithm and some possible ideas of applications. The report and code examples can be found [here](https://github.com/hei411/Treeresearch).

## Results

We submitted the report to the Hong Kong Youth Science & Technology Innovation Competition and we won the Silver Medal in the Senior Computer and Information Technology track. We also won the Intel Excellence in Computer Science Award, one of the grand prizes of the event.
